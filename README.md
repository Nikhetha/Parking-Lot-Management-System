# Parking-Lot-Management-System
The Parking Management System is a web application designed to manage parking spots efficiently. It features a React front-end for user interactions, a Spring Boot back-end for processing, and a MySQL database for data storage. The system allows users to add and delete parking spots, while admins can view all spots and fetch details.
